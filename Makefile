# ------- USER-DEFINED TARGETS ------- #
# create here your custom targets. All the targets here shall be safe to manipulate and delete, since they are not
# part of any automatic build: they shall be called only from the developer, for developing purposes.
# Notice: they can include and execute some of the default targets below.

# Here is an example:
# exampleTarget: configure clean generate
#	echo "example" &&\ <- add &&\ to concatenate shell commands
#	ls -l

.PHONY: build

#This special target is invoked on "make" command (with no args). Feel free to edit it.

#DEPRECATED
#This target sets up the docker container. Notice: This kind of commands (make targets with docker build/run commands inside)
# shall ONLY be used by the developer for testing the docker container creation, and NEVER be called by automated processes!
docker-build:
	docker build .

# ------- PROTECTED TARGETS ------- #
# Do not edit the below targets unless you REALLY know what you are doing.
# They are part of github actions and "standard" DIANA Software commands.
# They the failure of these targets could compromise automatic build and actions.
#If you need to add custom targets, just create one in the upper section!
